I used four of the projects listed in https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDcQw7AJahcKEwiQrbjupamBAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostinger.ph%2Ftutorials%2Fweb-developer-portfolio&psig=AOvVaw0f15rGKBj9teg5dOvm2R36&ust=1694753207533531&opi=89978449 as my previous projects example since I haven't had any previous projects yet. The text I used in my site was lifted from those four examples as well as their corresponding pictures.
